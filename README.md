I'm a Dominican American ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡´, born and raised in New York City. **Knicks in 7!** I'm a 2025 graduate from Baruch College with a BBA in Computer Information Systems and a minor in Math. I have a personal passion for technology, math, and self-teaching.

<h2>Currently:</h2>

- Iâ€™m working on a simple Python project that sends price alert messages. I want to be able to set alerts for multiple securities when they trade above or below target levels, or when there is abnormally high trading volume.
